Also, booked me to an optom', ""etrist just to make sure my actual eyes were not infected, thankfully not. Was prescribed Valacyclovir 1GM, 3 times a day for a week. As others mentioned, on the 3rd day of taking the prescription, the blisters healed and almost back to normal skin conditions on 4th to 5th Day. I was impressed. I imagine if I took it earlier if diagnosed correctly earlier, my symptoms would be much lesser. This was in combination of an ocular ointment/antibiotic to keep the skin around my eyes from catching any further infection since the skin was raw from still healing. I will continue on suppression treatment with Valacyclovir, which I heard is about 3 months of continuous dosage and some regular rhythm after. I recommend anyone who has these symptoms get checked by a dermatologist if they can or mention Eczema Herpeticum to your provider. Can be easily diagnosed as celluitis or impetigo, which prescriptions of antibiotics won't work again Eczema Herpeticum, since it's a viral infection-Herpes Simplex.

I went to the Dr 2 days after noticing an itchy rash on my back. The key is to get started on this med as soon as possible. The med and lots of prayer from my church family has kept my discomfort at a minimum. No nerve pain and the itching no worse than the poison ivy I routinely get. The blisters are drying up and no new ones are forming. The rash on my sides and abdomen have never developed into blisters. I am so thankful for the pr', 'ayers and for this drug. If you notice any itchy rash any where on your body, get to the Dr right away. Timing is important.  ']",[]
