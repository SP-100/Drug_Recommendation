I went to my doctor and was prescribed Acyclovir at 800mg 3 times a day. I took the meds for only one day. I woke up the next morning with my eye swelled shut. I immediately returned to my doctor. He suggested the shingles was causing my swollen eye. He said the shingles must be moving faster. He double my dosage from 800mg 3 times a day to 1600mg 3 times a day. \nI took that dosage for 2 days. The night of the second day I realized I was h', 'aving problems forming thoughts. It progress until my mind couldn’t form a thought. I began to lose my speech. I became panicked to the point of almost hysterical. I began crying, my husband became afraid. I kept trying to speak but I couldn’t! Could not form a thought except panic. All this happened in less than an hour. I was rushed to the ER. They immediately assumed a stroke. My speech soon slowly returned as the medication was wearing off. All the test for stroke came back negative. ER doctor was frustrated and finally said it may be the medication but doubted it. I was given an IV to flush the medication from my symptom. In about an hour all my symptoms were completely gone. I was told to stop the medication immediately. The doctors refused to admit it was the Acyclovir that caused my lose of speech and ability to form thoughts. I’m writing this because this is a very rare side effect that’s hidden from patients, but it can happen. I have never been so terrified in my life!

If you have shingles for longer than expected, there is two ranges of blood tests or alternatively a painless plug style biopsy which is very accurate for diagnosis.     I was still positive for the virus after six months and still have shingles going into my eight month.     It is disappointing to find the lack of articles explaining that the shingle', 's virus can last much longer than the 4-6 weeks, as most articles read, for those of us in that agonizing position, they don’t even allude to the possibility.    Acyclovir 800 mg five time per day does work to reduce the rash but not the swelling. When I stop taking the Acyclovir, it returns in a week or two. Overall Acyclovir is well worth it, to help reduce the redness and itching but not so much the pain and swelling. You can slowly reduce the medication to 3 per day, after you are under some control.     There is also an Acyclovir ointment, a little expensive not sure it helps as much, one or two times per day.     To be clear Acyclovir does significantly help with few limited side effects, the occasional headache, ringing in the ears, blurred vision.  ']",[]

All 18 screws and two 12"" rods had to be removed months later, with screws abutting my spinal cord. I was left with no fusion and no hardware to prevent movement at L5-S1, which is unbearable. A few weeks later I got shingles on the left side adjacent to the bottom half of one of the long incisions. I began with Valacyclovir 500 mg 3 X per day. I went through five bottles over five months.

So anyone that is wondering if you can have shingles for months on end, the answer is yes. I am entering the eight month and cannot have my spine surgery hardware put back in until it is gone completely, something that will be very unpleasant in itself. Acyclovir does work, as a maintenance drug to tamp it down, I do recommend it, but it will not kill it, just help. To be clear it is worth taking.

February 2008 I was diagnosed with HSV2 and I had never had an outbreak so I was never put on a supression medication.  Monday after Christmas I saw the doctor who prescribed Acyclovir 400mg 3X a day - every 8 hrs.  The pain went up to my lower sinus on the right side and clear down to the jaw bone on that side for 2 weeks.  Starting tomorrow I will be on my 5th week of this medication and my cold sore sti"", ""ll hasn't gone away.  After 3 weeks it stopped oozing and looked like a scar.  I was still having itching and tingling though.  This morning I woke up with what looked like a pimple head on my cold sore.  I hope to see my doctor this week regarding this.  To help prevent the spread of the cold sore, while it was still open and oozing, (it was the size of a quarter), I washed my bedding daily and the phone.  By the 3rd week I was washing the bedding once a week.  I have been very careful with my not touching my face as well.  ""]",[]

A few weeks ago I dropped to 800 mg per week and so far so good.    I know some people can not tolerate this medication due to side effects but luckily for me that has not been the case.    I am now pregnant and considering dropping altogether until I\'m in my 3rd trimester.  I know this will lead to outbreaks so am weighing risks/benefits.
