You can slowly reduce the medication to 3 per day, after you are under some control.

Well, I\'ve now started noticing some new ""things""...less irritability, more gumption to do things &, wait, where did my nightly racing heartbeat go?

I recommend anyone who has these symptoms get checked by a dermatologist if they can or mention Eczema Herpeticum to your provider.

I took Xyzal for 110 days (first 2-pack), then took a break over winter when I didn't need it as much, then restarted in March 2022. In the month and a half after restarting, I was getting continually more fatigued and achy, little by little, with almost a drugged/hungover feeling most every morning. Sometimes I would wake up, make a cup of coffee, sit on the sofa and practically fall back asleep; other times, I'd get up a"", 'nd have to go lay back down. It would take me until late afternoon to feel somewhat functional. I chalked this up to other issues (hormonal, life changes, work stress) but then stumbled upon something that discussed such side effects with allergy medicines. After doing extensive research, I\'ve found these effects are not as uncommon, or random, as they first appeared.\n\nAfter stopping the Xyzal about two weeks ago, I\'m no longer having the exhaustion, body/joint pain and drugged/hungover feeling every morning. It has been a marked, and remarkable, difference. Granted, I still have allergies...but I\'ll gladly take those over feeling like I was 137 years old.\n\nThe medicine worked well the first go-round with my allergies, but I\'ve learned that some brands have far more pronounced side effects after stopping and restarting.

In fact, every part of my body was itchy to the point of being nearly unbearable.  The allergic symptoms could have been due to so many things, it took a few days to narrow it down to 1 ', 'or 2 of the new meds.  GP put me on Xyzal (generic) and I immediately stopped my best guess at which drugs were doing this.  Within 36 hours, my allergic symptoms were gone, though I was having sweating and then cold attacks.  Then, just 3 days after the symtoms stopped, my neurologist asked me to take those 2 drugs 1 at a time, to determine which it was.  Limbrel attacked me much faster this time.  Incapacited within 48 hours.  Took Xyzal, took another 48 hours to get rid of the rest of the allergic symptoms, except for, same as last time, deep cough to the point of throwing up and not being able to eat, very weak, very cold (no hot this time), feels like very low blood pressure. Xyzal did what I needed to keep me from ending up in the ER or suffocating.  Praise God.

Yet, recently I\'ve been experiencing unexplained sleepiness, tiredness, and weight gain. I attributed all of these symptoms to stress, until I started having unexplained swelling of my feet, ankles, and lower legs, with occasional swelling of my hands, that started occurring daily. Two days ago while cooking dinner I got extremely dizzy and light-headed, and had to sit quickly so I didn\'t fall down. My head throbbed briefly before my vision cleared, and after a few minutes I was able to continue preparing dinner. I decided to look up Xyzal to see if it had any updated side effects and I see now that some of my symptoms could be attributed to this medicine. It is possible that long term use can cause side effects to be more likely, since I experienced none of those side effects until after I had used it for over a year, even though I hadn\'t used it continuously. I plan to go off Xyzal for a while and see if my symptoms lessen or go away. I hope I am able to find another allergy medicine that works as well in the meantime.']",[]

It worked great on his skin.  But...he  gained a lot of weight, he was hungry (starving) all of the time.  He would yell I'm hungry from his bead in the morning & wanted to eat until bedtime.  He was tired no matter how much sleep he got.  He was fatigued and did not want to be very active or couldn't be physically active for very long without tiring.  He was irritable and very emotional/depressed.  The symptoms cam"", 'e on gradually over the summer, so we thought it was some kind of growing issue.  I read online that Zyrtec can cause major depression in kids, so he stopped taking it.  Within days we saw drastic changes.  He was not as hungry & he said ""Mom I don\'t feel so sad inside anymore.""  He has been off the meds for 6 months, has lost almost all of the fat that he put on (it was cellulite-like fat), he\'s happier & he\'s full of energy & playing outside a lot!  He had a bad skin flare up a few months ago, so I gave him 1 pill thinking that it would clear the skin, but no side effects would show up from that 1 pill.  The next morning, he yelled from his bed, I\'m hungry!  Then, he cried & said how stressed out he was before school.  NEVER again will he take Zyrtec.  We reported this to his dermatologist who told us that he actually does clinical studies for Zyrtec & he had never heard anything like this.  I think it\'s because it comes on so gradual in the beginning that you don\'t even know that it is the medicine that is effecting your child so negatively.  If your child gets heavy & doesn\'t want to do anything anymore & feels sad, take him off Zyrtec & see what happens.']",[]

The antihistamine though *will* help calm down the itchiness and sneezing usually associated with allergies, and it will likely do that very effectively! If you also need help with decloging your nasal airways, you should either use the ""D"" concoction (with a decongestant), or use a corticosteroid spray. The latter is under Rx.
