(it was removed several times during this time period but had to be reinserted within few hours since still not normal). I have been fine ever since after that 9th month when removed.

Well, I\'ve now started noticing some new ""things""...less irritability, more gumption to do things &, wait, where did my nightly racing heartbeat go?

I had been so pleased by the relief from allergies that I never bothered looking at what else this little pill could do.
