Plus, I believe there is a rebound effect to consider; the more you take the more the need for it builds, thereby losing its effectiveness.  So, after taking more than the label advised for many years to combat the pain, I slowly weaned myself off of it.  Now I use relatively little (2-3 Extra Stre', ""ngth Tylenol per night) to take just the edge off the pain and because I no longer overuse it, what little I take is more helpful.  (I have chosen to not otherwise use medication to treat my Fibromyalgia pain, instead relying on exercise and other lifestyle choices.)  I'm also aware that Tylenol is processed through the liver so I avoid drinking alcohol when using it, which means most of the time.  ""]",[]
