I took Xyzal for 110 days (first 2-pack), then took a break over winter when I didn't need it as much, then restarted in March 2022. In the month and a half after restarting, I was getting continually more fatigued and achy, little by little, with almost a drugged/hungover feeling most every morning. Sometimes I would wake up, make a cup of coffee, sit on the sofa and practically fall back asleep; other times, I'd get up a"", 'nd have to go lay back down. It would take me until late afternoon to feel somewhat functional. I chalked this up to other issues (hormonal, life changes, work stress) but then stumbled upon something that discussed such side effects with allergy medicines. After doing extensive research, I\'ve found these effects are not as uncommon, or random, as they first appeared.\n\nAfter stopping the Xyzal about two weeks ago, I\'m no longer having the exhaustion, body/joint pain and drugged/hungover feeling every morning. It has been a marked, and remarkable, difference. Granted, I still have allergies...but I\'ll gladly take those over feeling like I was 137 years old.\n\nThe medicine worked well the first go-round with my allergies, but I\'ve learned that some brands have far more pronounced side effects after stopping and restarting. Again, I\'m writing this for those who might be concerned something is terribly wrong with them; since I have other long-term (but manageable) health issues, I was getting a little afraid that something else was happening or, that if this was just ""aging,"" I wasn\'t going to make it much longer! I\'m feeling so much better now that this medicine is out of my system. It sounds like it works for a lot of people, but some might find they\'re experiencing the same ""frog in the pot""-type symptoms--the ones that very slowly get worse and worse until you\'re wondering what the heck is happening to you.']",[]

In fact, every part of my body was itchy to the point of being nearly unbearable.  The allergic symptoms could have been due to so many things, it took a few days to narrow it down to 1 ', 'or 2 of the new meds.  GP put me on Xyzal (generic) and I immediately stopped my best guess at which drugs were doing this.  Within 36 hours, my allergic symptoms were gone, though I was having sweating and then cold attacks.  Then, just 3 days after the symtoms stopped, my neurologist asked me to take those 2 drugs 1 at a time, to determine which it was.  Limbrel attacked me much faster this time.  Incapacited within 48 hours.  Took Xyzal, took another 48 hours to get rid of the rest of the allergic symptoms, except for, same as last time, deep cough to the point of throwing up and not being able to eat, very weak, very cold (no hot this time), feels like very low blood pressure.

It worked great with little or no side effects, except that if I took it too close to bedtime it made me sleepy the next morning.

I'd need to take it daily for a few weeks or a couple of months about three times a year, and then only occasionally during t"", 'he ""off"" season. Yet, recently I\'ve been experiencing unexplained sleepiness, tiredness, and weight gain. I attributed all of these symptoms to stress, until I started having unexplained swelling of my feet, ankles, and lower legs, with occasional swelling of my hands, that started occurring daily. Two days ago while cooking dinner I got extremely dizzy and light-headed, and had to sit quickly so I didn\'t fall down. My head throbbed briefly before my vision cleared, and after a few minutes I was able to continue preparing dinner. I decided to look up Xyzal to see if it had any updated side effects and I see now that some of my symptoms could be attributed to this medicine. It is possible that long term use can cause side effects to be more likely, since I experienced none of those side effects until after I had used it for over a year, even though I hadn\'t used it continuously.
