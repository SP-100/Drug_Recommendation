I do have dry skin I use lotion for, however even if my skin isn't dry I still have skin itching. I started using Zyrtec, well the generic of it anyway, which is the same product. It works like a miracle for me in relieving my pesky itchy skin, but I have awful side effects where I get restless and anxiou"", ""s and have cognitive effects. I switched to Benadryl generic recently and while it doesn't work quite as long(not more than about 12 to 24 hours at most), it's slightly better for the anxiety side effect, but the anxiety is still there. Perhaps antihistamines give me that side effect? But I just can't handle the Zyrtec due to this! It's very effective for my itchy skin and works for well over 24 hours, but I had to quit. I should mention I have a long history of severe anxiety disorder, and take medication for it, so maybe I can't deal with Zyrtec as good? Be aware of this if you take antihistamines.

I only take it as needed. Luckily for me my allergies are only bad around this time of the year. I try not to take it everyday if I don't need it. I noticed with the 10 mg dose that after 24 hours the effect seems to be wearing off. But I try to space my dose out to 48 hours so I take it every other day. I've read a lot of the reviews with people having various side effects but for me I've never had any problems with itching or havi"", ""ng it caused me to have some sort of mental depression or any mental anxiety or any issue like this. The main side effect I noticed from this medication is that it makes me sleepy. For example when I take the dose I'll sleep for at least 8 hours the next day. And then maybe even nap some more the next day. Generally I don't sleep a lot or very well so I don't mind this side effect. I've been using this medicine for more than 10 years. I would tell people that they should be careful with it because it can interact with alcohol and if you take a dose it's still in your body for up to 48 hours from a single dose. I've tried other allergy medications but generally they do not work as well as this one and some of the other medications make me feel sort of well how can I say wired. And they keep me up so I prefer Zyrtec. Another thing I noticed about this medicine is that when I take the tablets it seems to bother my stomach a little bit. I don't have any pain or anything but I noticed some what loose stools. but I've switched to what we call a syrup version that's available in my country and I've noticed that this problem seems a lot less with the syrup that I was with the pills. So anyone who notices the loose stool I would recommend to try to syrup version if it's available for you. I know it's not available everywhere but I really feel like they should make it available. My opinion the syrup is better than the tablet but both work very well for allergy problems especially seasonal allergies. ""]",[]

I found that it took care of allergy symptoms but had a side effect of seriously affecting my ability to concentrate at work. So I went back to Claritin the next season, but ironically my dermatologist realized I had a rare reaction to Claritin so could no longer take it. With bad allergies, I tried Zyrtec again and tried to minimize how often I took it to bad allergy reaction days and just d', ""eal with the side effect. This season, I started taking Zyrtec again and realized some significant effects.  First, I've been working out regularly the past year and watching my diet quite well maintaining a certain weight, after taking zyrtec, in just a week or two my weight went up a whole 10 lbs and I'm heavier than I've ever weighed in my life. I've also noticed feeling tired all the time, and no matter how much sleep I get in a night I feel tired the next day. (which is very uncharacteristic of me).  I've felt that I've become more easily agitated and have less patience when I normally would be very patient. Lastly, at my birthday meal the other day, I realized my appetite had shot up as well since I'm not one to ever finish a meal out entirely and usually take some of it home; but this time, I ate the entire meal and still felt hungry afterwards.  I can't definitively say this is all due to Zyrtec; however, I have experienced some rather significant changes and the only real change in my daily routine has been to take a Zyrtec pill in the morning for allergies. After reading other people's reviews on this and seeing the effects myself, I will stop taking Zyrtec to see if any of what I have been feeling will go back to normal.""]",[]

Had been taking Clartin on/off since my early 20's. Sometimes it would work, most times felt like sugar pill. Decided to try Zyrtec as generic pills (cetirizine) had come down in price.    First I will say that this product works on allergies. After about 2 weeks of taking it I was able to breathe great through my nose, something unheard of for me. I didn't have the sneezing, snot rocket fits that always seemed to plague me every few days. I not"", ""iced one day that I hadn't sneezed once the entire month! No sinus pressure or headaches. No days of constant drip. I thought it was too good to be true. It was.    I devloped a strange rash in different places on my body. Sides of my feet, palms, and my fingers. My fingers got so itchy and dry, the skin would just crack near my joints. I would rub my fingers together all the time, even woke up doing it. And the medication dried my skin to the point where my hands had eczema and cracks all over. They looked like the hands of a 90 year old man who had been caught outside in a blizzard for weeks. It was torture, the itching everywhere. I didn't even know why, I tried sunflower oil on my skin and different remedies until one night I google Zyrtec and itching. Found out I was not alone.     From what I have read it makes you itch when it is not in your system. I took it daily but after a few hours it would wear off and I began to itch. After taking it for about 2 months I just stopped cold turkey. It took many sleepless nights and itchy days but finally I can say it is gone. My foot still has a little spot but my hands look so much better. The drug stays in your system for a LONG time as it took me over 3 months of quitting before I started to notice improvement. I tell everyone I know now to stay away. Google search others who have to take it to stop the itch. I'd rather have the allergies! ""]",[]

The antihistamine though *will* help calm down the itchiness and sneezing usually associated with allergies, and it will likely do that very effectively! If you also need help with decloging your nasal airways, you should either use the ""D"" concoction (with a decongestant), or use a corticosteroid spray. The latter is under Rx.
